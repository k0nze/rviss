# Harbor

## Project Scope

The goal of this project is to connect the `c_emulator` of the formal RISC-V ISA definition under `external/sail-riscv` to a SystemC hardware interface. The Sail RISC-V model owns ISA decode, execution semantics, architectural state, privilege behavior, and CSR behavior. Harbor should provide the integration layer around that model.

The intended direction is that the Sail RISC-V `c_emulator` boots a Linux kernel while selected platform resources, peripherals, timing, interrupts, memory, or cache behavior can be provided through SystemC models in this repository.

Do not reintroduce a separate hand-written RISC-V decoder or instruction semantics layer in Harbor unless explicitly requested. The previous standalone instruction-set-simulator direction has been superseded by the Sail RISC-V integration direction.

## External Dependencies

* `external/sail` contains the Sail compiler source dependency
* `external/sail-riscv` contains the RISC-V formal model and C emulator support code
* Treat both external directories as upstream dependencies
* Avoid modifying files inside external submodules unless the task explicitly requires a patch against the upstream project
* Generated files and build outputs inside external submodules should not be committed unless explicitly intended

## Build

Harbor uses CMake as the top-level build entry point.

* `harbor_sail_compiler` builds the Sail compiler from `external/sail`
* `harbor_sail_install` installs the Sail compiler into Harbor's local toolchain prefix
* The default Sail install prefix is `toolchain/sail`
* `toolchain/` is generated local output and should stay uncommitted

The known working OCaml setup is:

* OCaml `4.14.2`
* Menhir `20240715`
* an active opam switch named `harbor`

Follow `README.md` for exact setup commands. Keep the README updated when build requirements change.

## Integration Direction

The next integration milestones are tracked in `docs/sail-riscv-integration-todo.md`.

Prefer this order of work:

* build and install the Sail compiler from Harbor
* build Sail RISC-V's `riscv_model` from Harbor using the installed Sail compiler
* add a minimal Harbor wrapper around Sail RISC-V's `ModelImpl`
* add observation callbacks using Sail RISC-V's `callbacks_if`
* design and implement the SystemC/MMIO bridge
* avoid touching the Sail RISC-V platform model until the callback and wrapper path is understood

## Documentation

* Public API comments should use Doxygen-compatible doc strings
* Prefer documenting declarations in public headers under `include/harbor` instead of repeating the same documentation in source files
* Document interface contracts and architectural behavior, not implementation trivia
* Use Doxygen tags such as `@brief`, `@param`, `@return`, and `@note` when they add clarity
* When a method has architectural constraints or side effects, document them explicitly
