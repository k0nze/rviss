# Harbor

## Setup

### macOS

```bash
brew install qemu
brew install --cask docker
```

Start Docker Desktop before building the examples.

Build the shared example container once:

```bash
docker build \
  -t harbor-examples-builder \
  -f examples/Dockerfile \
  examples
```

All cross-compilation scripts use this image by default. Override it with
`HARBOR_EXAMPLES_DOCKER_IMAGE` if you build the image under a different tag.

## RISC-V Assembly Bare-Metal Example

Build the example ELFs in Docker:

```bash
examples/riscv/minimal/build.sh
```

This smoke example is implemented in assembly only. The shared Docker image
provides the RISC-V cross compiler and CMake/Ninja build tooling.

Run it on QEMU:

```bash
examples/riscv/minimal/run.sh
```

Expected output:

```text
Hello from Harbor RISC-V bare metal on QEMU
```

## RISC-V C Bare-Metal Example

Build the example ELFs in Docker:

```bash
examples/riscv/hello/build.sh
```

The shared Docker image provides the RISC-V cross compiler and CMake/Ninja
build tooling.

Run it on QEMU:

```bash
examples/riscv/hello/run.sh
```

Expected output:

```text
Hello from Harbor RISC-V C on QEMU
```

## Integration Checks

Build and run all current RISC-V QEMU examples:

```bash
tests/integration/run-riscv-examples.sh
```

The script builds the assembly and C ELFs in Docker and then runs both
examples on QEMU.
The host only needs Docker and QEMU for the bare-metal flow.

## Buildroot Linux Baseline

The first controlled Linux baseline for QEMU `virt` lives under:

```text
examples/linux/buildroot
```

Start with:

```bash
examples/linux/buildroot/fetch.sh
examples/linux/buildroot/build.sh
examples/linux/buildroot/run.sh
```

The fetch and build steps download external sources and can take a while.
Use the shared Harbor example container for the Buildroot build. Native macOS
is still useful for QEMU execution, but the build itself now runs inside the
container.
